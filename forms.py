# This file will run the logic for our forms
# FlaskForm gives us modules to enhance and secure our data collection from our forms

# StringField makes sure input is string
# PasswordField prevents users from showing password on screen
# SubmitField automatically ties submit time data with other fields

# DataRequired() and Email() run something like regex to make sure we're being given the right data type
